# PRSSV-distance matrix

Codes used for data handling, plotting and visualizing the results of the Sgarabotto et al. xxx paper. Da data came from a metagenomic survey. The pairwise distances were calculated as follows.

## Calculates distance in python

Using DistanceCalculator `distance_matrix_calculator.py`

Then we plot the downsampled distance matrix using this easy R script `heatmap_prssv.R`

## Plot the pairwise distance Figure 2B

From the whole dataset, we plot all the p-distance between sequences, grouping them by their source using this r script `Distance_plot.R`

## Suppelmentary

The `Supplementary_File' directory contains the supplementary files obtained from the Lazypipe output
